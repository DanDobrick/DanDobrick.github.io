<h1>Print and Play</h1>
  <p>
  On top of purchasing <em>new</em> board games, there is a subset of board gamers who like to make their own copies of boardgames with a process called "Print and Play" (PnP). There are multiple reasons that people make PnP board games:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Availability:</strong> Some games are out of print, and the only way that you can get them is to print them your self. There are also a few games that are PnP only, so you <em>have</em> to print them to be able to play them.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cost:</strong> PnP games only cost you the materials that you put into them; this ranges from simple printer paper and ink to entire boards and components made of wood or 3d printed.
    </li>
  </ul>

    Here is a gigantic photo of a game that <em>I</em> printed out and put together:
    <br>
    <img src="images/1889.jpg" alt="1889 Game" height="826" width="1080">
    <br>
    <p>
    The game is called 1889 and is out of print, but you can find copies ranging from $130-$250 on-line. My copy cost ~$40 and a <strong>LOT</strong> of my free time, but it was also quite relaxing at a time when I was fairly stressed out.
