  <h1>Overview of Modern Board Games</h1>
  <p>
    Modern board games are a far cry from the time of Monopoly, Chutes and Ladders and Dungeons and Dragons; there are tens of thousands of different boardgames

  <h2>Print and Play</h2>
  <p>
  On top of purchasing <em>new</em> board games, there is a subset of boardgamers who like to make their own copies of boardgames with a process called "Print and Play" (PnP)

    Here is a gigantic photo of a game that <em>I</em> printed out and put together:
    <img src="1889.jpg">
    <br>
    The game is called 1889 and is out of print, but you can find copies ranging from $130-$250 on-line. My copy cost ~$40 and a <strong>LOT</strong> of my free time, but it was also quite relaxing at a time when I was fairly stressed out.
