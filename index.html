      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a backend engineer who loves learning and creating, and I'm passionate about helping others do the same. I
        like to write software that will affect people's lives in positive ways; learning new things each day comes as a
        bonus! Coming from a background in education, I try to ensure that whatever I'm currently working on is
        intellectually stimulating while also bettering the lives of other people.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is a resume website so I should brag about myself a bit:
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm an experienced backend engineer with a product-centric mindset and strong leadership skills. I
        have a strong "get things done" ethic, deep sense of responsibility, and willingness to go above
        and beyond to ensure project success. I have a proactive attitude when it comes to both communication
        and collaboration, looping the right people in at the right time.
