  <h1>Overview of Modern Board Games</h1>
  <p>
    Modern board games are a far cry from the time of Monopoly, Chutes and Ladders and Dungeons and Dragons; there are tens of thousands of different boardgames that cater to various interests. One of the best things about board games is the interactivity that is inherent in playing them; not only are you getting to play a fun game, but you are also spending time with someone in your life. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now is the perfect time to get into the hobby of board gaming because there are more games than there have been in the past, and they are more available than ever. If you live nearby a medium-sized metropolitan area, there most likely is a store where you can purchase games and ask questions about what kind of games are right for you. If you <em>don't</em> live in an area with a game store, there are various resources on line that you can access such as <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/">Board Game Geek</a>. If you are concerned about the price of board games, <a href="PnP.html">Print and Play</a> is always an option.

  <h3>Comparison to Board Game Geek</h3>
  <p>
    <a href = "http://www.boardgamegeek.com/">BoardGameGeek.com</a> (BGG) is one of the largest websites dedicated to boardgames.<br>
    I'm actually very surprised to see that most of the tags of BGG are ones that I'm using on this page; the exceptions being &lt;center&gt; and &lt;span&gt;. I guess this shouldn't surprise me much seeing BGG is notoriously ugly and outdated for how popular of a site that it is. I think this is due to the overuse of tables and text; it gives me a feeling of information overload and looks fairly cluttered.
