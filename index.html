    <div class="tab-content" id="about">
      <p>I am a software engineer who loves learning and creating, and I'm passionate about helping others do the same. Making websites allows me to create something that will affect people's lives in positive ways while also learning new things each day. Coming from teaching high school math, coding is how I keep the analytical part of my brain occupied while satisfying the need to solve a good puzzle.</p>
