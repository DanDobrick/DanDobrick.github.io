  <h1>Overview of Modern Board Games</h1>
  <p>
    Modern board games are a far cry from the time of Monopoly, Chutes and Ladders and Dungeons and Dragons; there are tens of thousands of different boardgames that cater to various interests. One of the best things about board games is the interactivity that is inherent in playing them; not only are you getting to play a fun game, but you are also spending time with someone in your life. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now is the perfect time to get into the hobby of board gaming because there are more games than there have been in the past, and they are more available than ever. If you live nearby a medium-sized metropolitan area, there most likely is a store where you can purchase games and ask questions about what kind of games are right for you. If you <em>don't</em> live in an area with a game store, there are various resources on line that you can access. My favorite resource is called <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/">Board Game Geek</a> and has information on ~85 THOUSAND games, with forums, reviews and sometimes even videos talking about the game.

  <h2>Print and Play</h2>
  <p>
  On top of purchasing <em>new</em> board games, there is a subset of board gamers who like to make their own copies of boardgames with a process called "Print and Play" (PnP). There are multiple reasons that people make PnP board games:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Availability:</strong> Some games are out of print, and the only way that you can get them is to print them your self. There are also a few games that are PnP only, so you <em>have</em> to print them to be able to play them.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cost:</strong> PnP games only cost you the materials that you put into them; this ranges from simple printer paper and ink to entire boards and components made of wood or 3d printed.
    </li>

    Here is a gigantic photo of a game that <em>I</em> printed out and put together:

    <br>
    The game is called 1889 and is out of print, but you can find copies ranging from $130-$250 on-line. My copy cost ~$40 and a <strong>LOT</strong> of my free time, but it was also quite relaxing at a time when I was fairly stressed out.
